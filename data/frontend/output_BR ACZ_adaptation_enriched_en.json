            "Description": "Increase the permeable and semi-permeable areas in buildings and public spaces under the administration of the City, with the adoption of nature-based solutions (NbS). In areas with space limitations, the action includes feasibility analyses for implementing permeable pavements and increasing green areas in roadways. Among traditional construction solutions, there are features such as curbs and gutters with stormwater drains, as well as larger-scale solutions like retention ponds. Nature-based solutions include urban tree planting, green roofs, rainwater cisterns, bio-swales, and more.",
