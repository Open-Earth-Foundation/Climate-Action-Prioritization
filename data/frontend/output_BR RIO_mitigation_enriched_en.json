This can particularly benefit underserved communities by providing them with knowledge and resources to reduce waste effectively.\n \n 4. **Community Engagement**: The policy can foster community engagement by involving residents in discussions about waste management and reduction strategies, ensuring that the voices of vulnerable populations are heard and considered in the decision-making process.\n \n 5. **Equitable Resource Allocation**: By focusing on waste reduction, the policy can lead to more equitable allocation of resources for waste management services, ensuring that underserved communities receive adequate support and infrastructure to manage their waste effectively.",
