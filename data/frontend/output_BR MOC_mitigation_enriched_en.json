PES programs can incentivize sustainable land management practices that protect ecosystems, which in turn can help regulate water cycles, reduce erosion, and mitigate the impacts of both droughts and floods. Given the city's low-income socio-economic factors and very low access to public services like water and sanitation, such programs can also provide economic benefits to local communities while addressing critical environmental challenges.
