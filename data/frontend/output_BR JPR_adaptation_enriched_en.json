            "Description": "Restoring and sustainably managing marine, coastal, urban, riverine, and wetland ecosystems to protect against climate hazards such as storm surges, floods, and heatwaves. Efforts include agroecology, coastal and marine vegetation and reefs, vegetation corridors, mangrove habitat restoration, urban green space to reduce temperatures. These actions improve biodiversity, store carbon, enhance water quality, and provide socio-economic and cultural co-benefits.",
