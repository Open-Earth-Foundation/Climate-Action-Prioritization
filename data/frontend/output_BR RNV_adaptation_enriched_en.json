These measures aim to mitigate climate-induced impacts by improving water management, reducing stormwater runoff, enhancing water quality, and supporting agriculture and energy production under changing climate scenarios. Multi-purpose water reservoirs and dams provide additional benefits by addressing water shortages and managing risks associated with natural hazards.",
