        "explanation": "The preservation and recovery of water bodies is a crucial action for S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti. Given the city's tropical rainforest biome and the high population density, healthy water systems are vital for environmental stability and public well-being. While not the highest priority, this action contributes to mitigating risks associated with droughts and floods, which are significant hazards for the city. Maintaining water body health can also indirectly support public health and food security, both of which face high risks from various hazards. Investing in this area helps build resilience against future climate impacts.",
