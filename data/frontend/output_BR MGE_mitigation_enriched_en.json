These systems allow residents to rent electric bikes for short trips, reducing the dependence on cars for urban transportation. By integrating electric bikes, cities can further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and promote a healthier and more sustainable mode of transportation for both urban and rural areas. This initiative also supports mobility equality, as it makes bikes more accessible to a wider range of people.",
